# PHSX815_Week5

These programs are available in this repository:

* Circularpython.py [Python] which uses rejection sampling method to sample uniform random numbers in a 2D and 3D spherical shell.
* Trap_Gauss_python.py [Python] which compares the trapezoidal rule with the Gaussian Quadrature methods, or numerical integration to evaluate a function in a finite interval.

# Usage

The usage of two separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* matplotlib (python)
* numpy (pyhon)
* scipy.integrate (python)
* sympy (python)
* mpl_toolkits.mplot3d (python)

They following python file 

* Circularpython.py 
* Trap_Gauss_python.py

can be run from the command line by typing:

`<> python Circularpython.py `
`<> python Trap_Gauss_python.py`

This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python packages numpy, sympy, scipy.integrate and Matplotlib also installed.
