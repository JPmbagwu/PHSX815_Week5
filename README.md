# PHSX815_Week5

This program is available in this repository:

* Circularpython.py [Python] which generates uniform random numbers in a 2D and 3D spherical shell using the rejection sampling method.

# Usage

The usage of these separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* matplotlib (python)
* numpy (pyhon)
* scipy.integrate (python)
* sympy (python)
* mpl_toolkits.mplot3d (python)

The following python file 

* Circularpython.py 

can be run from the Command/Terminal line by typing:

`<> python Circularpython.py `

This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python packages numpy, sympy, scipy.integrate and Matplotlib also installed.
